How to run:
Download the otrio folder, just run otrio.py.

How to play:
Tic-tac-toe but with 2-4 players and more win conditions. 
Win conditions - 3 in a row with the same size pieces for all, 3 in a row for ascending size pieces (i.e. small, medium, large in that order), 
  all 3 pieces in 1 cell. 
Though unlikely, having no remaining slots for a piece left will result in a draw.
