GAME RULES:
Tic-Tac-Toe but you can have up to 4 players rather than just 2. Win conditions are different - 3 in a row with either the same size piece or ascending type (small, mid, large).

Possible changes in the future:
Eventually plan to have P2p connectivity for multiplayer. 
Currently there are unlimited uses of a piece. Can change this later.
Currently colors are also fixed. 
Can use a 3rd party package that looks better than tkinter. Currently tkinter is my only option however, so using another package will require someone else.
Multiple resolutions available in the options, including full screen (maybe).

Big ups liquid richard,
